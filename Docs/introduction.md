# I3T - An Interactive Tool for Teaching Transformations
I3T is an educational application which enables the study of 3D transformations and their hierarchy 
in an illustrative way. This tool is a result of master's thesis done
at the Department of Computer Graphics and Interaction, FEE, CTU in Prague.

We presented the tool at the [Eurographics 2018](https://www.eurographics2018.nl/) conference 
(Petr Felkel, Alejandra Magana, Michal Folta, Alexa Gabrielle Sears, Bedrich Benes: 
I3T: Using Interactive Computer Graphics to Teach Geometric Transformations).
