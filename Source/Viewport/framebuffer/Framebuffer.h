/**
 * \brief A utility class for managing an OpenGL FrameBufferObject.
 *
 * Usage:\n
 * - //Create fbo object\n
 * - fbo.start(); //The fbo is lazily initialized here if necessary\n
 * - //Render stuff\n
 * - fbo.end(); //<b>The fbo is unbound by BINDING THE DEFAULT (0)
 * FRAMEBUFFER!</b>\n
 * - //Multisampling is resolved here unless fbo.end(false) is called\n
 * - //Get color texture using fbo.getColorTexture()\n
 * <br>
 * Supports multi sampled antialiasing (MSAA) which can be enabled in the
 * constructor. When MSAA is enabled, the framebuffer creates a second intermediate framebuffer instance which is used
 * to "resolve" the multisampled framebuffer into a regular one.
 * <br><br>
 * Multisampled framebuffers with multiple color
 * attachments are also supported. In that case the intermediate framebuffer creates an equivalent singlesampled color
 * attachment for each multisampled one.
 * <br><br>
 * Note that the framebuffer sampling settings overwrite any attachment
 * settings as all attachments must have the same sample count and either be all multisampled or none.
