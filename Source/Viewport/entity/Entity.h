	/**
	 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:
	 * Derived entity classes should expect a certain kind of shader and be able to directly static cast to it.
	 * Currently there is no error checking and wrongly passed shader type will CAUSE UNDEFINED BEHAVIOUR!
	 *
	 * Using dynamic casts instead might be undesirable (slow) here (this might just be a premature optimalization)
	 * Generally the shader passed to this method is the m_shader of this entity.
	 * However we need functionality that allows us to change the shader temporarily (like for drawing silhouettes)
	 * Because of this the shader can also sometimes be something else, usually some derived type of the one the entity
	 * expects. I couldn't find a way to inform what kinds of shaders an entity is able to use in its render methods.
	 * The type of the shader must be the base Shader class and so some kind of casting must occur.
	 *
	 * Another option could be to use some kind of a typeid/enum system that tells us what type a shader is (rather than
	 * use dynamic cast). But that approach ignores inheritance which we need and having multiple types of shaders and
	 * entity member variable seems very inflexible.
	 *
	 * The true elegant solution probably doesn't involve inheritance at all and rather uses composition, together with
	 * an ECS or something. But it was decided to not dive into that realm and so we are stuck with this seemingly
	 * simple but not very flexible inheritance structure.
